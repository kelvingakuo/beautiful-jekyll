If you have lived in Kenya as long as I have, the term 'Harambee' should, at the very least, ring a bell. 'Harambee' is a Swahili term that literally means 'all pull together'. If you need help, be it money-wise, labour-wiseâ€¦ it doesn't matter, all you have to do 'ni kuita Harambee' and your community's got you!! Harambee is such a revered activity in Kenya, it's our country's official motto! (I bet you didn't know that) *To be clear, I do realise pulling together is not exclusively Kenyan*
