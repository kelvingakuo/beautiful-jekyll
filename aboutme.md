Conceived somewhere in May 2018, this corner of the internet is here to show the kind of interesting, inciteful, insightful things you can dig out from all kinds of data simply by applying the right data science and ML techniques.

If you love ML/AI, all the magic that comes with it, pretty charts, and intuitive explanations on how to apply data science to interesting projects, then look no further!!!

My name is Kelvin Gakuo but everyone calls me Gaxx. 

I'm a self-taught data scientist & ML engineer, a huge proponent of [open source contributions](https://pypi.org/user/kelvingakuo/) and [mental wellness](http://twitter.com/mymjkuat)

Oh, before I forget; I built a self-driving car!!! See it in action [here](http://bit.ly/2Kmccts)
